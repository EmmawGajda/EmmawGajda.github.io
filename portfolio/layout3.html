            <p>"In the following paper, I will explain how the form of love letters, their textual shape and contents, helps them to achieve their social purpose as a means of sharing vulnerability. I will deconstruct three letters, written by three different authors, and specify to the reader what traits they have that make them a love letter, and how those same traits act as a way to accomplish the letters’ intentions. The aim of this analysis is to show the variety with which love might be communicated, but at the same time, the consistency of love as a collective emotion.
                <br>
             <p>To begin, we must first ask: What is a love letter?"</p>

            <p>"The 2000s were a time marked by low-rise jeans, chunky sneakers, smartphones, and a huge environmental disaster. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S., killing and displacing thousands of people, destroying homes and businesses, and causing billions of dollars in damage. Katrina acted as a wake-up call to many; if someone wasn’t directly affected, they knew someone who was, and the country came together to help those in need. 
              This disaster, coming only a few years after the horrors of 9/11, found a country primed for “unity.” The need to “stick together” was still beating in the hearts of many, and the aftermath left in Katrina’s wake—magnified through social media, newspapers, and morning newscasts—forced the citizens of the U.S. to see the truth: Our planet was furious with us. From this, the “special interest group,” also known as environmentalists, transitioned from a label for “hippies” into the mainstream consciousness." </p>

              <p>"Susan Glaspell’s 1916 one-act play “Trifles” delves into the complexities of womanhood in the early 20th century, using the investigation of a small-town farmer’s murder to explore the life of his accused killer and wife, Mrs. Wright—formerly Minnie Foster, a woman whose personal being is at the heart of the story. Through the lens of this rural murder mystery, Glaspell examines the oppressive dynamics of marriage, the marginalization of women’s voices, and the quiet but fierce rebellion that can arise from years of emotional and psychological neglect. Glaspell uses Mrs. Wright, as well as the symbol of her pet canary, to effectively reflect the broader experience of many women in the Midwest during this era, illustrating their struggles. Isolation results from Mrs. Wright’s home in a “hollow” land, her farm out of sight of any main roads. This isolation leads to Mrs. Wright’s sense of repression, captured in her nonchalant attitude towards her husband’s death. Mrs. Wright’s identity as Minnie Foster is eclipsed by her role as a housewife, one which many women of that time and place experienced. The play’s seemingly simple domestic setting becomes a stage for much larger societal forces that stifle women’s independence and personal agency. It offers a powerful critique of the social norms that confine women to the role of a wife, often at the expense of their spirits."</p>

  <p>"In high school, teachers can often seem like the least important people in the room—at least from a student’s point of view. What matters most to teens is how they’re seen, how they feel, and who likes them. As a result, students may not realize that their teacher is doing more than just assigning tasks—they’re shaping the environment in which learning happens, for better or worse.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This ethnography argues that an English teacher’s most impactful role isn’t grading essays or lecturing on literature, but is fostering a positive classroom culture—because a supportive environment is essential for students to grow as writers." </p>
