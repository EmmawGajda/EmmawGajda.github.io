          <br>
            <p>In the following paper, I will explain how the form of love letters, their textual shape and contents, helps them to achieve their social purpose as a means of sharing vulnerability. I will deconstruct three letters, written by three different authors, and specify to the reader what traits they have that make them a love letter, and how those same traits act as a way to accomplish the letters’ intentions. The aim of this analysis is to show the variety with which love might be communicated, but at the same time, the consistency of love as a collective emotion.
                <br>
             <p>To begin, we must first ask: What is a love letter?</p>
             <br>
             <p>A love letter is a form of poetry. It is a declaration of intent, a deliverer of adoration, and most uniquely, it is the immortalization of the most decent of emotions. Love letters are meaningful and diverse. They can be delivered via the post, by hand, or, in the modern age, electronically. They take on many shapes and forms. They might be silly or sweet or severe. They might be romantic or they might be practical. They might be rambling verses of prose, or they might just be a flash on a screen. However, they are not completely without uniformity, and amidst their chaos, they do contain a set of rules and guidelines, though they are a limited bunch. </p>
            <br>
            <p>For one: A love letter must be written. It must appear on a page, and it must involve words or symbols. For instance, a love letter cannot be just the song, sung aloud, but it can be the written lyrics. A love letter’s written trait identifies its being a letter and not something else entirely. This first rule seems to be outwardly obvious, but its importance is one which cannot be overstated. Writing one’s feelings down in words, rather than speaking them aloud, gives the writer the advantage of time. It allows the writer the ability to revise their ideas and voice their feelings without the fear of fumbling in the moment. Corresponding to the benefit of revision, written words convey a sense of deliberateness. They give their readers the feeling that there is a
            thoughtful purpose to their patterns, and confidently appear as more than a rushed brandishing of ‘word vomit’. They are deliberated upon and handpicked, making them special. Furthermore, written composition gives thoughts permanence. Writing makes ideas tangible, which consequently makes them infinite. A good portion of a love letter’s power is held in its potential to be treasured physically. It may be read over and over again, providing its reader with the ability to hold on to the feelings it evokes, eternally. Lastly, a written letter is distributable. It is able to be literally delivered from author to reader, giving it a portability that aids in its employment. This first rule of love letters, that they must take on a written form, makes them timeless, boundless, and never-ending.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The second rule of a love letter is: It must be addressed to someone or something. The receiver may be a person–anyone from spouse to stranger–but it might also be a place, a time, or an object. Love is unfussy in that way. This rule that requires a recipient to make a love letter possesses a duplicity which makes it simultaneously personal and shared. A receiver implies a giver, and thus, this giver must be the one to record their tenderness. With tenderness comes a feeling of intimacy, something many wish to be secret or at least exclusive. However, in directing this familiarity to another, though not necessarily offering it, there is a level of exposure that makes it no longer private. This contrasting phenomenon creates a vulnerability in a love letter which is a driving force in its success. Moreover, the subject of a love letter, regardless of who or what it is, is wholly necessary. Without a specific addressee, there is no material of which to write. A recipient provides content. For example, a love letter might be written to something completely obscure–like the warm slant of light through a window–and because of its elusiveness, it might seem too abstract, like it couldn’t possibly be a love letter, yet as long as it addresses something, it is. An author having an object of desire is vital to the objective of a love letter, which is to convey devotion.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The third rule, more focused on content, is: That a love letter must hold a level of vulnerability. A love letter might do this in one of many different ways. It might lyrically describe the subject. It might contain proclamations. It might declare love obviously, or it might show it tacitly. It may show feeling in any way that it wishes to, whether it be through jealous jabs, pained pronouncements, or adoring affirmations. For some, a hypothetical love letter appears as a positive and grand thing. Many believe it will contain the phrases “I love you” or “I miss you” but this is not always the case. It is not uncommon that a love letter might speak of hatred and pain, however, it remains a love letter if there is still a level of admiring vulnerability within it. </p>
        
        <br>
               <p> We now understand that the key elements of a love letter—written words, a specific subject, and an expression of vulnerability—are what give it both form and power. In the following analysis of three distinct letters, I will highlight their differences while also showing how, despite these differences, they all remain love letters at their core.</p>
                <br>
            <p>The first letter I will analyze is often referred to as “The Desperate Adulteress” and can be found in The Letters of Vita Sackville-West to Virginia Woolf. In it, Sackville-West writes a simple, yet profoundly reverential letter to Woolf, describing the impact she has on her. She praises Woolf’s literary skill, expresses her admiration, and confesses her deep longing. In the opening lines, she declares, “I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia” (Sackville-West, 12), immediately establishing the rawness of her feelings. The beauty of her letter lies in this unadorned sincerity—there are no ambiguities or hidden meanings. The reader need not decipher her emotions; her devotion is clear. She writes, “It is incredible how essential to me you have become” (Sackville-West, 12), and this clear delivery of helpless worship makes her affection all the more touching. Her vulnerability is further emphasized when she closes by saying, “Please forgive me for writing such a miserable letter” (Sackville-West, 12). This plea for forgiveness shows that Woolf’s opinion matters deeply to her. The straightforward language and candid expressions of love make this letter an open declaration, showing that love can be both profound and uncomplicated. Through its adoration of Woolf’s literary genius and Sackville-West’s emotional transparency, the letter touches, timeless in its directness and earnestness.
                The second letter, Pablo Neruda’s “Sonnet XVII”, addressed to his third wife Matilde Urrutia, is a love letter, even though it is not specifically entitled as one. Though Neruda is widely appreciated for his romantic poetry, this sonnet of his stands out as one of his most celebrated works. It captures a love that is quiet, ineffable, and deeply rooted in the very structure of being. The language Neruda uses is vivid and haunting, conjuring images of a connection that is deeply personal. When he writes, “I love you because I know no other way than this: where I does not exist, nor you” (Neruda, 19), he speaks of a love that feels more like an instinctive, inseparable union than a conscious choice—an attraction beyond control. This
                type of love is not like the vocal admiration of Sackville-West, who praises Woolf’s intellect and skill. Instead, Neruda’s love is instinctual, almost mystical, and centered on the merging of identities. Though his sonnet differs from Sackville-West’s earnest expression of admiration, it carries its own power and depth, capturing a love that is both unspoken and extensive. In its quiet intensity, Neruda’s letter reveals that love can be overridingly powerful, no matter the form it takes. </p>
            <br>
               <p>The third letter is from a current novel, The Wicked King. Written by Holly Black, Cardan, her male protagonist, writes a series of letters to Jude, Black’s female protagonist, pleading for her swift return after her temporary banishment from his world. Letter after letter, he writes to her with no response, where he confesses his feelings and begs forgiveness. However, in his final letter, having still received no answers, he writes only her name, “JUDE JUDE JUDE” repeated over and over, before ending with a simple and desperate “please, Jude” (Black, 54). This minimalistic letter speaks volumes through its repetition, conveying Cardan’s deep anguish and longing. The repetition of Jude’s name focuses attention on his desperation, while the final line—“please, Jude”—delivers a compelling emotional jab. The lowercase “please” conveys his vulnerability, making the letter feel raw and unguarded, a true declaration of love. While Cardan’s letter contrasts with the more elaborate expressions of affection in Sackville-West’s and Neruda’s letters, its strength lies in what is absent. It demonstrates that a love letter doesn’t need grandiosity to be potent. As long as it conveys vulnerability and devotion, it can be as triumphant in its purpose as any other.
                These three love letters, though vastly different in form and content, are all love letters nonetheless. Their labeling as love letters is not defined by magnificent promises or declarations, which is clear from the moving honesty of Sackville-West’s reverence for Woolf, nor is it about being explicitly labeled as such, clear through the beauty of Neruda’s quiet sonnet. It is not even about endlessly expressing feelings or infatuation, as shown in Cardan’s simple and desperate plea in The Wicked King. No, the essence of these letters lies in something deeper: intention. It’s about the act of sharing one’s emotions and exposing one’s heart—whether those feelings are great or simple, whether the expression is intricate or raw. The power of a love letter is not in its creative flair but in its willingness to be vulnerable. At its core, an expression of written love,
               sent or not, is defined by its purpose: to convey love and openness to another, no matter how straightforward or complex the emotions may be. </p>
            <br>
            <p>This need, to convey feelings of love, is something most people experience at some point or another in their lives. People meet people, they get to know one another, and they fall in love. They are altered by others–by their habits and interests and ways of being in the world–and often they feel the need to express their happiness for these changes. This is the reason love letters are so successful in their goal of expressing a person’s care. They are capsules of moments and feeling. They let their reader know the writer’s feelings and thoughts and allow their writer the space to express them. They permit grace and time, making them truthful, real, and perfect. Perfect, not in syntax, but in sentiment. Love letters are the progeny of time and inspiration. They are timeless and powerful, evolving with each new letter written. Ultimately, the enduring value of a love letter lies not in its artfulness or its structure, but in the courage it takes to put one’s feelings on paper. In this way, they continue to serve as the perfect vehicles for human connection, ensuring that, as long as love exists, love letters will persist.</p>

            </section>
            <p> The 2000s were a time marked by low-rise jeans, chunky sneakers, smartphones, and a huge environmental disaster. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S., killing and displacing thousands of people, destroying homes and businesses, and causing billions of dollars in damage. Katrina acted as a wake-up call to many; if someone wasn’t directly affected, they knew someone who was, and the country came together to help those in need. This disaster, coming only a few years after the horrors of 9/11, found a country primed for “unity.” The need to “stick together” was still beating in the hearts of many, and the aftermath left in Katrina’s wake—magnified through social media, newspapers, and morning newscasts—forced the citizens of the U.S. to see the truth: Our planet was furious with us. From this, the “special interest group,” also known as environmentalists, transitioned from a label for “hippies” into the mainstream consciousness. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Four years later, in 2009, at the University of Portland’s commencement ceremony, Paul Hawken, a decorated author, business owner, and, most importantly, environmentalist, spoke to a room full of the newest members of the workforce and implored them not just to care, but to take action. Hawken’s address—delivered at a time when the Earth was hotter than ever, millions of people were without homes, and there was a general sense of hopelessness about the planet's future—remains one of the most emotionally stirring environmentally focused commencement speeches of the 21st century. While some rely on staggering statistics and figures to strike fear, and ultimately action, into their listeners, Hawken chose a different path. He chose hope. And the heavy hitter of his quest for a more hopeful future? Emotionally evocative language. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The choice to focus on pathos was deliberate, as Hawken took careful note of the speech’s genre and its audience. A college commencement speech is unique because of the audience it addresses. While speeches of hope and the future can be delivered to any group, a commencement speech is defined by the graduates in attendance—individuals embarking on a new chapter in their lives. People who are excited, nervous, and hungry for what’s to come. People who feel like the world is theirs, wide open and beautiful, and Hawken made sure to play on that. He cultivated a surge of protective territorialness in his audience. Knowing the youthful passion filling the room, he invoked memories, visuals, and feelings to ensure his audience was moved and engaged before reminding them that what they have can be lost. Hawken seized the opportunity to address an issue with enormous stakes for the future: The climate crisis. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Hawken, born in California, had a challenging early life—he was unhoused for a portion of it and struggled with severe asthma from childhood. His condition was discovered when he was only five months old, making him the youngest case in San Mateo, CA. However, he made it to college and eventually opened his own natural food store, a passion he realized after ‘curing’ his asthma through self-induced trials focusing on diet. After opening his store, he embarked on a global search for the most genuinely organic foods to sell. He met with hundreds of farmers, examined different types of land, and witnessed firsthand the destruction humans inflicted on the Earth in the pursuit of profit. Hawken saw the planet defiled—burned, ripped, and defeated over and over again. He observed how humans, driven by an insatiable thirst for more—more land, more products, more money—would do anything to the world and, by extension, their fellow humans. It was then that he resolved to take action. He studied for a decade the planet’s history, patterns, and changes of the past hundred years, and formed numerous ecological-focused companies and projects. He has now authored nine books, six of which have ended up on global and the NYT’s bestseller lists. In 2009, he was sixty-three years old, educated beyond measure, and at the forefront of the environmentalist movement. </p>
            <br>
            <p>As a champion of ecological restoration, Hawken was a ‘pro’ at giving speeches, and at the University of Portland, standing before a thousand or so graduates, Hawken made sure his message was directly applicable to his audience. It wasn’t just a warning but an invitation for the next generation to take the lead in repairing a broken system. The commencement speech genre allows for a blend of formal rhetoric, personal reflection, and a call to action, and Hawken used these elements effectively. He not only highlighted the urgency of the environmental challenges but also urged graduates to see themselves as pivotal figures in resolving these issues. The occasion of graduation added weight to his words, empowering him to inspire graduates as they took their first steps into the rest of their lives.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hawken’s speech utilized a blend of logical reasoning and emotional appeals. Although his primary reliance was on pathos to inspire action, he used logos strategically to reinforce the credibility of his message. </p>
            <br>
            <p>One of the most notable uses of logos occurs early in the speech when he states:</p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
            ...every living system is declining, and the rate of decline is accelerating. Kind of a mind-boggling situation…but not one peer-reviewed paper published in the last thirty years can refute that statement (Hawken).
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <p>This opening statement immediately positioned the environmental crisis as a fact, supported by scientific evidence. By grounding his argument in data, Hawken silenced potential skeptics and established his credibility. To further strengthen his position, he referenced respected figures such as Buckminster Fuller, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Janine Benyus, and Mary Oliver. By aligning himself with these trusted names, Hawken supported his own authority and encouraged the audience to take him seriously.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Having laid the foundation with facts and credibility, Hawken then proceeded to lay out his message in a clear, four-step approach: first, he outlined what had happened; second, he explained why his audience should care; third, he reassured them that they are not alone in the fight; and fourth, he emphasized the urgency of the cause.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To begin, Hawken describes the environmental decline using accessible language to make the issue relatable:</p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
            This planet came with a set of instructions, but we seem to have misplaced them. Important rules like don’t poison the water, soil, or air, don’t let the Earth get overcrowded, and don’t touch the thermostat have been broken (Hawken).
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <p>By presenting these “misplaced instructions” in a familiar, almost playful tone, Hawken made the environmental issues understandable and engaging for his audience. This not only simplified the problem but also appealed to the audience, as the young graduates might have heard similar rules from their parents, and parents in attendance might have declared them. He then spoke about how humans have become complacent in comfort, riding around on “Spaceship Earth”—a phrase coined by Buckminster Fuller—indulging in good food and forgetting that it will need to land eventually. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Hawken then shifted the metaphor, presenting Earth not as a spaceship but as an employer, seeking to hire his audience to protect it. By humanizing the planet, he stressed the responsibility humans share in taking care of it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hawken then appealed to the audience’s sense of gratitude and responsibility by asking them to reflect on the beauty the planet offers:</p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
            The Earth couldn’t afford to send recruiters or limos to your school. It sent you rain, sunsets, ripe cherries, night-blooming jasmine, and that unbelievably cute person you are dating (Hawken).
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <p>This imagery, filled with sensory details, evokes feelings of warmth and appreciation for the natural world. Hawken used this moment to stir up gratitude for the planet, reinforcing the idea that humans have been given so much and owe it all to the Earth. This gratitude set the stage for the next phase of his speech: The harsh reality that what is cherished can be lost.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Playing off of the feelings of indebtedness he created, Hakwen then chose to counterbalance the grim realities of climate change. He used a two-pronged approach. First, he acknowledged the severity of the crisis:</p>
            <br>
            <blockquote> 
            If you look at the science about what is happening on Earth and aren’t pessimistic, you don’t understand the data… (Hawken).
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <p>This sobering remark prepared the audience for what comes next: An inspiring message about the global movement working to restore the planet. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Hawken then immediately follows up with:</p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
            But if you meet the people who are working to restore this Earth and the lives of the poor, and you aren’t optimistic, you haven’t got a pulse (Hawken).
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <p>With this he reassured the audience that they are not alone in the fight. Millions of people worldwide, from all walks of life, are working toward a better future. Solidarity and collective action creates hope, and Hawken showed that change is possible through unity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As the speech built to its climax, Hawken stressed the urgency of addressing the crisis. He drew on a powerful quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson:</p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
            ‘What would we do if the stars only came out once every thousand years?’ No one would sleep that night, of course. The world would create new religions overnight. We would be ecstatic, delirious, made rapturous by the glory of God. Instead, the stars come out every night and we watch television (Emerson)(Hawken).
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <p>This quote, so powerful in its imagery, speaks to the idea that humanity often takes the Earth’s beauty and bounty for granted, failing to recognize their extraordinary value. With this metaphor, Hawken implored his audience to take action, urging them to recognize the planet’s importance and act.</p>
            <p>Hawken concluded with a powerful challenge to the naysayers and the hopeless:</p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
            The most unrealistic person in the world is the cynic, not the dreamer. Hope only makes sense when it doesn’t make sense to be hopeful (Hawken).
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <p>With this final call to action, Hawken asks his audience to reject cynicism and embrace hope, even in the face of an overwhelming challenge. By emphasizing the importance of hope, Hawken asserts that true change comes from daring to believe in a better future, no matter how impossible it may seem. </p>
            <br>
            <p>While Paul Hawken’s speech is a masterclass in rhetorical strategies, it can also be seen as a failure in terms of its broader impact. The climate crisis has only worsened since the speech was delivered. Carbon emissions continue to rise, and the devastating effects of climate change are becoming more visible each day. While the speech may have inspired many individuals to take action, it clearly did not prevent the acceleration of environmental degradation. </p>
            <br>
            <p> One possible reason for this failure exists in the very nature of Hawken’s message. He asks his audience to ignore what others say and take personal action. While this is a noble call to responsibility, the reality is that the climate crisis is not solely the result of individual actions but is driven by powerful, systemic forces—namely, large corporations and political structures. Hawken’s emphasis on personal responsibility, while motivating, fails to fully address the systemic and political barriers that halt meaningful change. His audience, though young and earnest, was still a part of a larger system shaped by economic interests and political passivity, forces that are difficult for the individual to combat on their own.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, if the true purpose of the speech was not an attempt to halt or fix climate change, but rather an effort to foster hope and inspire action, then Hawken’s speech can be seen as a success. While it may not have led to widespread systemic change, it served its intended purpose of motivating individuals to care about the planet and take personal responsibility. </p>
            <br>
            <p>“You Are Brilliant, and the Earth is Hiring” is a reminder of the need for action on the climate crisis, and remains relevant through the continuation into uncertain times both environmentally and socially. For me, however, it stands as a reminder to remain hopeful, even when things seem out of control. In a world where the weight of global challenges can feel overwhelming, Hawken’s words offer me a sense of empowerment and possibility. </p>
            <br>
            <p> The power of Hawken’s speech lies in the mix of emotional and logical appeals found within it. Hawken used them to connect with his audience, encouraging them to take personal responsibility for the environment. And even though the climate crisis has only grown worse since the speech, Hawken’s words continue to inspire people to care and act. His speech may not have fixed everything, but it succeeded in encouraging people to believe that change is possible, even at the individual level. </p>

              <p>Susan Glaspell’s 1916 one-act play “Trifles” delves into the complexities of womanhood in the early 20th century, using the investigation of a small-town farmer’s murder to explore the life of his accused killer and wife, Mrs. Wright—formerly Minnie Foster, a woman whose personal being is at the heart of the story. Through the lens of this rural murder mystery, Glaspell examines the oppressive dynamics of marriage, the marginalization of women’s voices, and the quiet but fierce rebellion that can arise from years of emotional and psychological neglect. Glaspell uses Mrs. Wright, as well as the symbol of her pet canary, to effectively reflect the broader experience of many women in the Midwest during this era, illustrating their struggles. Isolation results from Mrs. Wright’s home in a “hollow” land, her farm out of sight of any main roads. This isolation leads to Mrs. Wright’s sense of repression, captured in her nonchalant attitude towards her husband’s death. Mrs. Wright’s identity as Minnie Foster is eclipsed by her role as a housewife, one which many women of that time and place experienced. The play’s seemingly simple domestic setting becomes a stage for much larger societal forces that stifle women’s independence and personal agency. It offers a powerful critique of the social norms that confine women to the role of a wife, often at the expense of their spirits.</p>
<br>
<p>Glaspell’s choice to present her play entirely within the home of the Wright family serves as a commanding marker of isolation, reflecting the constrained lives of the female characters and highlighting the social forces that shape their actions and relationships. In the small, dimly lit home, two investigations are conducted. One is led by a trio of men—a lawyer, a sheriff, and a neighboring farmer—who are focused on gathering evidence to prove Mrs. Wright’s guilt. The other, an informal investigation, is carried out by two neighboring women, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters. The women are tasked with collecting Mrs. Wright’s personal belongings that she will receive in jail. Though both investigations mainly center around the same person—Mrs. Wright—their approaches and motivations are vastly different. The men, driven by the need to confirm Mrs. Wright’s crime, approach the scene with skepticism and judgment. Her lack of emotional response to her husband’s death—marked by the absence of screaming, crying, or any visible signs of distress—raises significant suspicion among the investigators, revealing societal expectations about a woman’s countenance. The women, however, conduct their investigation empathetically, guided by a shared understanding of the hardships faced by women in their small town. Where the men see a disorganized house, spoiled preserves and dirty towels, the women see a scene. Through their inspection of Mrs. Wright’s world, her quilting, canning, and other evidence of aspects of homemaking, they find themselves coming to terms with the events that likely led to Mr. Wright’s death. And through the course of their discussions, they discover a secret box in her sewing materials, which contains the key to the story: a dead canary.</p>
<br>
<p>The symbol of the dead canary, often a powerful image of restriction, highlights Glaspell’s genius. A bird in nature, free to fly wherever it desires, represents ultimate freedom. It exists in a world all its own, creating songs and soaring high. Through caging a once emblematic example of freedom, that natural right is stripped away, leaving the bird a mere shell of its former self. Glaspell’s use of this metaphor seamlessly translates to the experience of the 20th-century Western American woman, living in a farming community. Constrained and deprived of any space for themselves, their spirits wither, leading to a slow, internal death. The image of this sort of 20th century womanhood as a dead bird reflects the stifled flight of forced domesticity and the desperate, human, need for more. Within the story, the canary serves as a perfect symbol of Minnie Foster—and by extension, the plight of women of that time and place. </p>
<br>
<p>In the story, Minnie Foster’s struggle–the death of her spirit–created Mrs. Wright. Her pet canary, said to have been purchased from a traveling merchant, is assumed by Mrs. Hale and Peters, to have been an upbeat and song filled creature. This is not unlike that of Mrs. Wright in her youth. Mrs. Hale describes Minnie Foster as a vibrant girl, who used to love to sing in the town choir, and who “...used to wear pretty clothes and be lively when she was Minnie Foster” (Glaspell, 13). This description of Minnie’s past, full of beauty and song, mirrors the canary’s earlier existence. But the emphasis on Minnie Foster no longer existing parallels the bird’s death, suggesting that Minnie’s vitality was extinguished when she became Mrs. Wright. Mrs. Hale even says, “...come to think of it, she was kind of like a bird herself…”, completely solidifying the connection between Minnie and the canary, both once full of life and song, now silenced. (Glaspell, 20). </p>
<br>
<p>Even the way the bird is discovered—its neck broken and its body carefully wrapped in silk—becomes a powerful symbol of Mrs. Wright’s emotional state. When Mrs. Peters reacts to uncovering the bird by “suddenly put[ting] her hand to her nose”, her instinctive gesture suggests that the bird has been dead for some time, its lifelessness now saturating the room (Glaspell, 20). This reaction mirrors the suffocating, oppressive atmosphere that pervades the Wright household—one where emotional vitality has been stifled, much like the bird’s song. The canary’s confinement and eventual death reflect the emotional confinement of Mrs. Wright, whose spirit has been choked by years of isolation. Furthermore, Mrs. Peters’ comment, “Seems funny to think of a bird in here”, takes on added significance when we recall that Mrs. Hale has already made a connection between Minnie Foster and a bird (Glaspell, 18). This comparison between Minnie and the bird, once free and joyful, now trapped and silenced, deepens the symbolic weight of the canary’s death. The bird’s fate mirrors that of Mrs. Wright’s own, not the death of her physical body, but of her spirit instead. The canary’s death echoes the loss of her former cheerful identity, showcased by her lackadaisical reaction to her husband’s gruesome death. </p>
<br>
<p>The reader understands that while the canary represents Minnie Foster/Mrs. Wright, she represents women as a whole. Through Mrs. Wright’s character, Glaspell illustrates how many women of the early 20th century were similarly confined, silenced, and oppressed by the rigid expectations of homemaking and marriage. Mrs. Wright’s plight is not unique but is, rather, representative of the larger societal condition of women during her era. Glaspell makes it clear that Mrs. Wright is just one of the many through her other female characters, and the camaraderie that they show her. Though Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters find the bird, a clear piece of evidence that could incriminate Mrs. Wright, they choose to protect her. Despite their limited knowledge of her, they feel compelled to shield her from judgment. Mrs. Hale states, “I’ve not seen much of her of late years”, when asked if they are friends, and yet she bristles at the flippant remarks the men make, like she cares for her (Glaspell, 11). The women’s shared defense of Mrs. Wright’s housekeeping skills, as well as the offense they take when spoken down to by their male counterparts, illustrates the commonality of an existence like Mrs. Hales. The empathetic nature of their investigation is also indicative of their collective experience.</p>
<br>
<p>However, both the male and female characters in “Trifles” ultimately forsake a fair and impartial investigation, allowing personal biases, assumptions, and emotional influences to shape their conclusions. The men arrive at the scene determined to prove Mrs. Wright’s guilt, and their investigation is characterized by dismissiveness and an overt disregard for any empathy or deeper understanding of the circumstances that may have influenced her actions. They focus solely on superficial details—such as the disarray of the house and Mrs. Wright’s lack of visible emotional response to her husband’s death—without considering that she could be in shock, or even feeling relief, without being guilty. They also dismiss the women’s findings as mere “trifles,” undermining the significance of the emotional and domestic clues that the women uncover. On the other hand, the women, though more empathetic and understanding, also partake in tampering with the evidence. They conceal the dead canary, knowing it would directly incriminate Mrs. Wright, choosing instead to protect her out of a shared sense of solidarity, even though this undermines the pursuit of justice. While their motives were rooted in compassion, their actions distorted the truth by prioritizing Mrs. Wright’s well-being over a fair, unbiased investigation. In this way, both groups do Mrs. Wright an injustice. The men engage in corruption through their prejudiced, incomplete investigation, while the women do so through their emotional interference. The combined effect is a “null” investigation, where neither side is able to conduct a truly objective inquiry, and the truth remains hidden under layers of personal bias and moral compromise.</p>
<br>
	<p>This opacity surrounding the events of Mr. Wright’s murder also raises several questions for the reader: Did Mrs. Wright really sleep through her husband being garroted right next to her? Could she, a small woman, have killed her farming husband? Did he kill her canary, or could she have done it out of her own disillusionment? The questions the short play raises are numerous, and the reader can only speculate. Glaspell’s “Trifles” seems to call for a second act—one in which Mrs. Wright is put on trial and the truth is finally uncovered. It would be an act where her mistreatment—her isolation, repression, and loss of identity—are considered by an impartial jury. One where her guilt is not assumed from the start and where she is given the opportunity to plead her case.</p>
<br>
<p>Through Mrs. Wright’s character, Glaspell paints a desperate portrait of the troubles faced by many women in the early 20th century, particularly those in isolated, rural communities. The gendered expectations of the time restricted women to roles defined by domesticity, while simultaneously suffocating their voices and ambitions. For Mrs. Wright, the transition from the vibrant Minnie Foster to the repressed Mrs. Wright was a gradual but suffocating process. This process was shaped by a husband who, like the oppressive social forces of the era, seemingly muted her spirit and limited her freedom. The canary—once a symbol of her joy and vitality—becomes a poignant metaphor for the emotional and psychological toll of her isolation. Its death mirrors the death of her former self, silenced and stifled by a combination of social neglect and marital repression.</p>
<br>
<p>Glaspell’s play is a critique of the ways in which women’s lives were rendered invisible and their suffering disregarded, both in their personal relationships and in the eyes of the law. The investigation, flawed on both sides, illustrates the broader societal failure to understand or acknowledge the lived experiences of the 20th-century Midwestern farmer’s wife. In the end, both groups—the men and the women—fail to offer Mrs. Wright the fair and impartial investigation she deserves. Through “Trifles”, Glaspell offers more than a simple rural murder mystery; she provides a window into the suffocating world of the early 20th-century Western American woman. Mrs. Wright’s story is representative of the larger social conditions that marginalized women in rural America. Ultimately, the play reminds us of the importance of truth, justice, and decency, urging us to see the cages around us and encouraging us to break free of them. By shedding light on these oppressive structures, “Trifles” calls for a deeper understanding of the human need for freedom, empathy, and the recognition of one’s worth beyond prescribed roles. It challenges us to look beyond surface-level judgments and consider the deeper, often unseen forces that shape lives, especially the lives of women, whose stories have so often been overlooked.</p>
