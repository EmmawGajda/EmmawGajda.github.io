<h1> Emma Gajda </h1>
<p> Welcome!</p> <img src="../images/headshot.jpg" alt="Emma Gajda">
<p>It's nice to meet you, I'm Emma! I am a hopeful author and prospective editor. </p>
<p>I am in my second year as an English major at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, though I received my Associate's at Greenfield Community College. 
I spend my days writing and reading literature and nonsense, and find great joy in both. </p>
<p>I am currently re-reading Lynne Truss's <i>Eats, Shoots, and Leaves </i> and William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White's <i>The Elements of Style</i>, and, as I am forever attempting to sharpen my writing,
I am greatly enjoying them. I find that these two seem to always demand my focus when I'm feeling scttered or unenthused about whatever projects I'm working on. If I could suggest any book to someone interested in the "rules" of writing, it would without a doubt be
Strunk's revised <i>The Elements of Style</i>, as I think that his incisive demands and the brilliant E.B. White's somewhat sardonic reflections are exactly what any writer needs to hear. </p>
<p> I hope you give it a try. It is the perfect pocket-book.</p>
