        Hello!
      </p>
      <p> I am currently a student at UMass Amherst who is studying English, with a focus on Writing, Rhetoric, and Literacy Studies.
        However, I began my higher education at Greenfield Community College (GCC) and received my Associate's Degree from them in 2023. 
        I currently work as a Ready-Set-Read! Tutor in a local school. I teach young scholars, kindergarten through second grade-aged students, 
        hot to read. In this work I have developed an interest in science-based reading teachniques, as well as a fondness for teaching elementary school students. 
      </p>
      <p>(To get rid of the white space below my footer I added padding to the footer in CSS.) </p>
      <p>
     Below is a list of a few of my interests:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li> Teaching in Secondary Education </li>
