<p>I am a dog lover (I have four: Ginger, Sadie, Joy, and Roo), an exercise and caffeine fiend,
and a book enthusiast. </p>
 <p>Currently, I attend UMass Amherst and am pursuing a degree in English. 
However, I spent my first two years of college at Greenfield Community College (GCC) as a Biology major. I decided I was studing the wrong subjects
when I realized that I love to read, write, and talk way more than I love studying cells and elements. And, since switching my major I'm more excited about my future than ever.</p>
<p>For me, English has always been the discipline I am most passionate about. I love the creativity and analysis that comes with writing, 
and I find reading, expecially novels, to be the most wonderful thing in the world. And athough I'm not specializing in creative writing, in my opinion, there is nothing more beautiful than a
perfect book,and my dream is to someday write one for someone else.</p>
