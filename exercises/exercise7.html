    <p> This first paper is one that I wrote last semester (Fall 2024) that I think best illustrates my style of writing.
        My professor in the class I wrote it for gave us a lot of room to write about things that interested us on personal levels. 
        I found that in their class I was able to do some of my most honest and passion-filled work, and I believe this paper exemplifies the spirit of that.</p>

    <p> I wrote this second paper last semester (Fall 2024) in a class that was very outside my comfort zone. I had taken it with the intention of filling a space in my schedule, 
        but it ended up being much more than just a slot-filler. The topics we covered, as well as the papers we wrote, were challenging and aked me to grow as a thinker. 
        In this paper, one of my final ones for the semester, I was asked to analyze a short story through the lens of the female empowerment and existence that occured during
        that time. I had never written about such things. Once I began, I realized it was going to be much more difficult than I thought, but I believe I rose to the occasion.

    <p> This third and final paper is one that I wrote this semester (Spring 2025) and that aligns more notably with the field of study I am currently interested in. 
        In this paper I discuss the effects of systemic opression on minority students' educational experiences. As of right now, my focus is very much on topics such as this, 
        as I am studying the new theory and practice of "The Science of Reading".
