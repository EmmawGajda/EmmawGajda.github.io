<h1>These are a Few of My Favorite Things...</h1>

<h2>My Dogs!</h2>
<p>Just like everyone else who owns dogs... I believe that mine are the best.</p>
<p> My first dog is Ginger. She is an aging chocolate lab who I got on my eigth birthday, and who I believe is a literal angel sent from above. 
<br>She is loyal, loving, sweet, and now that she's a bit older, very calm. She is a true pal.</p>

<p>My second dog, and this order is based on when I got them, is Sadie. She is a very quiet, very shy, lab/shiba mix.
<br> She loves to sit and watch the world from a quiet corner, but she is also a huge love bug. </p>

<p>My family and I believe she had a rough go of it when she was a puppy, and that is why she is so jumpy. 
<br>However, she's also a bit deaf and her breed (shiba inu's) are known for being more sentinel than party animal.</p>
<p>My two final dogs, Joy a four-year-old grumpy black lab/corgi mix, and Roo, a one-year-old pitbull/lab mix, are the babies. 
<br>They are sweet and fun, though Joy is more cat than dog, and I absolutely adore them. </p>
