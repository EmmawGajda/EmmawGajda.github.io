<h1><img src="../images/headshot.jpg" alt="Emma"/>    Introduction  </h1>
    <p>Hello. My name is Emma Gajda, and I am a senior at UMass Amherst.
        I am a commuter, and I spend all of the time that I'm on campus in South College as I am an English major.</p>
        English has always been the field of study I find myself most excited about, and through taking courses at UMass
        I have realized that I am very interested in the topics of rhetoric and writing. 
        <p>However, outside of academic settings, I am most passionate about creative writing. I hope to eventually pursue it in an official capacity, though
        after graduation, I plan on taking a fellowship at a local private school.</p>
